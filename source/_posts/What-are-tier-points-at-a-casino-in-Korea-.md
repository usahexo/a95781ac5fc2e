#  How do you earn tier points at a casino in Korea? 

Casinos in Korea award customers different types of points according to the amount they spend. The more money you gamble, the more points you earn.

The casino operator determines how many points a customer will earn for each dollar wagered. In general, the rate is about 2 or 3 points per dollar played. So for example, if you play $100 then you’ll earn 200 or 300 points. 

There are four tiers which affect how many benefits a customer can enjoy: basic, silver, gold, and platinum. The tier is determined by how many points a customer has earned in the past 6 months To qualify for a higher tier, players must earn at least 1,000 points in that time period. 

Points usually expire after 6 months if not earned. However, some casinos offer bonuses where players can use their points to buy free spins or other benefits. 

So how do you actually redeem your points? It depends on the casino but most likely it will involve going to the rewards desk and presenting your card. Then the staff will convert your points into cash which you can use however you like – either buy chips to continue playing or withdraw as cash.
