#  How to Split 10s in Blackjack and Win! 

When it comes to splitting 10s in blackjack, there are a couple different schools of thought. Some players advocate splitting every time, while others believe that there are specific circumstances when it’s better to hold on to the 10s. In this article, we’re going to explore both strategies and see which one is more likely to lead to a winning hand.

First, let’s take a look at the basic strategy for splitting 10s. If you split 10s, you’re essentially dividing your cards in two and playing each hand as if it were a new game. This gives you two opportunities to get closer to 21 without going over. However, if the dealer has an Ace up, you should only split if your first card is a 9 or higher. If your first card is lower than 9, then you should hit the hand instead of splitting.

There are also times when it’s better not to split 10s. For instance, if the dealer has a low card up (6 or lower), then it might be wise to simply hit the hand instead of splitting. This is because the dealer is more likely to bust if they have to hit again, giving you a better chance of winning.

In general, splitting 10s is a good way to increase your chances of winning at blackjack. However, there are times when it makes more sense not to split them. By using both strategies, you can give yourself the best chance of coming out ahead at the casino!

If you are dealt two 10s, it is always a good idea to split them. This will give you more opportunities to win and increase your chances of getting a good hand. Keep in mind that when you split 10s, you are essentially playing two hands of blackjack instead of one, which gives you more chances to win.

In the blackjack game, splitting 10s can be a great way to increase your chances of winning. When you split 10s, you are essentially creating two hands, each with a starting value of 10. This gives you more opportunities to win and can also lead to bigger payouts.

Dean Cain is a blackjack expert and he knows how to take advantage of this particular playing strategy. In the following video, Cain explains how to split 10s and offers some tips for improving your odds of winning.

It's important to remember that when you split 10s, you should always hit on the first hand and stand on the second hand. This is because the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. By hitting on the first hand and standing on the second hand, you can maximize your chances of achieving this goal.

Another thing to keep in mind is that you should never split Aces. This is because splitting Aces essentially turns them into two new hands with a value of 1 each. As a result, your chances of winning are significantly reduced.

When it comes to splitting 10s, Dean Cain offers some excellent advice. By following his guidelines, you can give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack.

#  Tips for Splitting 10s in Blackjack from Dean Cain 

If you're looking to improve your blackjack game, splitting 10s is a good place to start. Here are three tips from Dean Cain that can help you split 10s more effectively:

1. Only Split If the Dealer's Card Is an Ace or a Ten

When the dealer shows an ace, they have a strong hand and are likely to hit. If the dealer has a ten, they already have a blackjack and cannot go bust. In both of these cases, it's usually not worth splitting your 10s.

2. Wait for the Dealer to Play First

If you split your 10s and the dealer has blackjack, you automatically lose. By waiting for the dealer to play first, you can get a better sense of their hand before deciding whether or not to split.

3. Know When To Take Your Lose and Walk Away

Even if you follow all of these tips, there's no guarantee that you'll win every time you split your 10s. Sometimes it's best to walk away with your original bet rather than risking further losses.

#  Is it Better to Split 10s in Blackjack?

The answer to this question is a resounding yes! In fact, splitting 10s is one of the best blackjack strategies that you can use in the game. When you split 10s, you are essentially making two hands out of one, which gives you a higher chance of winning.

To split 10s in blackjack, all you have to do is place an additional bet equal to your original bet beside your original bet. Once the cards are dealt, you will then be able to play each hand separately. If you are dealt two cards of the same value (eg. two kings), then you will want to automatically split your hand.

If you are lucky enough to hit a blackjack when splitting 10s (i.e. get a card with a value of 10 or 21), then your winnings will be doubled! This is why splitting 10s is such a great strategy – it significantly increases your chances of winning and can result in some big payouts too.
