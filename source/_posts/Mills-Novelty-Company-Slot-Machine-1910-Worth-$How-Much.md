#  Wilder: A Mill worth $How Much?

This week, the mill in Wilder, Vermont was sold for $2 million to a developer. Some say it's worth more, as the land around it is worth more than that. The new owner plans to build homes around the mill, which will likely bring even more value to the property.

The mill has been an important part of Wilder since it was built in 1810. It was originally used to produce flour, but it has been vacant for many years. The new owner plans to renovate it and use it to produce food products like organic granola and cookies.

This is great news for Wilder and for the Vermont economy. It's always encouraging when someone buys an old building and restores it instead of tearing it down. The new owner has already hired a few people to help with the restoration, so we can expect this project to create some jobs in the area.

Wilder is a small town with a population of just over 1,000 people. It's located in Windham County, which is one of the most rural counties in Vermont. The county is known for its beautiful scenery and its small towns dot the landscape throughout its 944 square miles.

The completion of this project should help to revive Wilder and bring some much-needed economic stimulus to the area. We hope that other developers will see what has happened in Wilder and be encouraged to invest in other properties in the area.
