The game can be played by up to four players, and each player has 14 pieces. The game board is marked with a plus (+) sign in the middle and four corner circles.

To play, select a color and place your character in one of the corner circles. Your opponent does the same. The player who is first to move is determined randomly.

To move, select a character and drag it to an adjacent square. If there is another of your pieces in that square, you capture your opponent’s piece and remove it from the board. If there is no other piece, then you may place your piece in that space or continue moving.

If you are able to reach the center square with one of your pieces, you capture your opponent’s piece and remove it from the board. The first player to capture all of their opponent’s pieces wins the game.
