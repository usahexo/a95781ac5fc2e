#  Legalized Sports Gambling Could Bring in Billions in Tax Revenue

State and local governments could see a windfall in tax revenue if sports gambling is legalized, according to a report from the American Gaming Association (AGA).

The report, released Monday, estimates that legalizing sports betting at the state level could generate up to $8.9 billion in new tax revenue annually. That number accounts for the taxes that would be collected on both the gaming industry and on bettors themselves.

“As we’ve seen with other forms of gambling, legalized sports betting will create jobs and generate significant economic impact across a variety of industries,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA.

Freeman noted that billions are already being wagered illegally on sports each year, so there is potential for a large market to develop should sports betting be legalized. He added that authorizing and regulating the activity can help ensure it is conducted safely and responsibly.

The AGA’s report comes as several states are considering bills to legalize sports betting in the wake of a Supreme Court decision last month that struck down a federal ban on the activity.

New Jersey is expected to be among the first states to offer legal sports betting, with Governor Phil Murphy recently signing a bill into law that allows casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports wagering. The law is slated to take effect later this year.

Other states where legalization efforts are underway include Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Rhode Island, and Michigan.

#  It's Time to End the Black Market for Sports Gambling

The black market for sports gambling is a billion-dollar industry that is long overdue for reform. It’s time to legalize and regulate sports gambling in the United States, which would bring billions of dollars in new tax revenue to state and federal governments.

The black market for sports gambling thrives because it’s illegal. By legalizing and regulating sports gambling, we can eliminate the criminal element from the equation, and create a safe and legal alternative for those who want to bet on sports.

Legalizing sports gambling would also generate billions of dollars in new tax revenue for state and federal governments. This money could be used to fund important public programs, such as education and infrastructure.

So why hasn’t this already happened? There are a few powerful interests that are opposed to legalizing sports gambling, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. These organizations stand to lose millions of dollars in revenue if sports gambling is legalized.

However, the tide is beginning to turn on this issue. A growing number of states are beginning to realize the benefits of legalizing sports gambling, including increased tax revenue and economic growth. In fact, a recent study by Econsult Solutions found that legalizing sports betting in New Jersey could generate up to $1.3 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years.

It’s time for Congress to act on this issue and legalize sports gambling nationwide. The benefits of doing so are clear, and it’s time to end the black market for sports gambling once and for all.

#  Legalized Sports Betting Would Create Thousands of Jobs

The United States’ economy is in a slump, but if Congress legalizes sports betting, that could change.

According to a report from the American Gaming Association (AGA), if sports betting is legalized nationwide, the economy would create thousands of jobs.

Today, only four states allow sports betting: Nevada, Delaware, Montana, and Oregon. But eight more states have introduced legislation to legalize it this year.

Legalizing sports betting would create an economic impact of $261 million annually in new tax revenue and nearly 26,000 jobs. That’s in addition to the more than 150,000 people who are currently employed in the gaming industry.

The AGA commissioned Oxford Economics to conduct the study. It found that legalizing sports betting would generate $5.3 billion in consumer spending each year and increase gross domestic product by $3.9 billion.

States that have legalized gambling have seen an increase in tourism and revenue from other sources such as sales and income taxes. In Nevada, for example, taxes on casino gaming generated $533 million in 2017 – up from $486 million in 2016.

Clearly, legalizing sports betting would be good for the economy – and not just the gaming industry. It would create jobs and generate tax revenue for states around the country.

#  Let Gamblers Play: The Economic Case for Legal Sports Gambling

In the United States, gambling is only legal in a limited number of states. This might be changing, as there is a growing movement to legalize gambling, specifically sports gambling. Some proponents of legalized gambling argue that it will generate tax revenue for the government. Others argue that it will create jobs. This article will make the economic case for legalizing sports gambling.

First, let’s consider how much money is currently being spent on illegal sports gambling. A recent report from the American Gaming Association estimated that $150 billion was wagered on U.S. sporting events in 2017. That’s a lot of money! Legalizing sports gambling would allow the government to tax this activity and generate revenue.

Second, legalizing sports gambling would create jobs. There are currently thousands of people working in the illegal sports betting industry. These jobs would be made legitimate if sports gambling were to be legalized. In addition, new businesses would likely open up to take advantage of the legal market for sports betting. This would create even more jobs.

Finally, legalizing sports gambling would help stimulate the economy as a whole. Gamblers wouldn’t just be betting on sporting events; they would also bet on other things such as stocks and commodities. This would create demand for related goods and services, such as online betting platforms and data providers. All in all, legalizing sports gambling would be good for the economy!

#  Why Sports Gambling Should Be Legal

It is no secret that the United States has a love affair with gambling. From casinos to lotteries to horseracing, Americans love to put their luck to the test. So it seems only natural that sports gambling would also be legal and popular in this country. Yet, while other forms of gambling are legal and widely accepted, sports gambling remains illegal in most states.

There are many arguments for and against legalizing sports gambling. Those in favor of legalization say that it is a victimless crime and that it should be regulated just like any other form of gambling. They argue that the government could make a lot of money from taxes on sports betting, and that it would create jobs in the gaming industry.

Those who oppose legalization contend that sports gambling is addictive and can ruin lives. They worry that it would lead to more crime and corruption, as well as increase the number of problem gamblers.

So what is the truth? Is sports gambling a harmless form of entertainment or is it a dangerous addiction that should be outlawed? The answer is not clear cut, but here are some of the pros and cons of legalizing sports betting:

Pros:

1) Gambling is a legal and legitimate form of entertainment in most forms in the United States.
2) The government could make significant revenue from taxes on sports betting.
3) It would create jobs in the gaming industry.
4) It is a victimless crime- those who lose money gamble willingly.
5) It can be addictive, but so can other legal forms of entertainment such as alcohol and drugs.
6) It can lead to more crime and corruption, but so can other legal activities such as cigarettes and alcohol.
7) Regulating sports betting would help protect consumers and ensure fairness.
