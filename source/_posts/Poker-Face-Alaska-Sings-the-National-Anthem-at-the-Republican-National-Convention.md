#  Poker Face Alaska releases a new album: My Heart is in the Frozen North

After spending time in the studio, Poker Face Alaska has released a new album: My Heart is in the Frozen North. The album consists of 11 tracks, all of which were written and recorded by the band themselves.

"This album means a lot to us," said vocalist and guitarist Amanda Kowalczyk. "It's our first album as a fully independent band, and it's been a long time coming."

The album is focused around the idea of winter, and how it can be both beautiful and isolating. "We wanted to capture the feeling of being isolated in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by snow and ice," Kowalczyk said.

The songs on the album vary in style, but all share the common theme of winter. "There's a bit of everything on this album," bassist Lorne Atchison said. "We've got rock songs, folk songs, even a few ballads."

My Heart is in the Frozen North is available now on iTunes and other streaming services.
